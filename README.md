# DiskUsage

**Languages:** [English](README.md) | [Русский](README.ru.md)

A fast, privacy-first disk space analyzer for macOS built with SwiftUI.

## Why DiskUsage
- Instant clarity: tree or sunburst view to spot space hogs quickly.
- Built-in actions: reveal in Finder, copy path, move to Trash.
- Works anywhere: scan home, full disk (`/`), or any folder.
- Minimal friction: local scanning, no accounts, no tracking.

## Core Features
- Disk info bar with total/used/free space.
- Sortable tree view with inline size bars.
- Sunburst view for at-a-glance hotspots.
- Settings for default view, language, delete confirmation, hidden files.
- English & Russian localization.

## Requirements
- macOS 14.0+
- Xcode 15+

## Setup
1. Open `DiskUsage.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2. Build and run.
3. If scanning protected areas, grant **Full Disk Access** in System Settings → Privacy & Security.

## Status & Roadmap
- Current: source-only distribution.
- Next: further development is planned soon; new features and updates will be announced separately.
